          Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815â€“1852), was an English mathematician
          and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose
          computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had
          applications beyond pure calculation and created the first algorithm intended to be carried
          out by such a machine. She is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
